It is a system tray icon only. Play icon indicates keyboard input is active; stop sign indicates the keyboard input is blocked.

The source code is less than 5000 characters, please read it if you're curious.

It has no interface besides the system tray icon.  To close the program, you can close it thru Task Manager.

You can open "Other system tray icons" (in Taskbar Settings) to make it always shown, like in the screenshots above. Then you can put the exe (or a shortcut to it) in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` to run it on startup.
